This is an outdated version of this collection of functions, the most recent
version is published under the MIT license here: https://github.com/jwallnoefer/graphepp

The aim of this project is to provide functions for Pauli-diagonal
noise channels and the ADB multipartite entanglement purification protocol for
two-colorable graph states. (Ref. PhysRevLett.91.107903, PhysRevA.71.012319)

All states are assumed to be diagonal in the graph state basis corresponding to
the graph state considered.
The noise should work for arbitrary graph states, while the purification
protocol only makes sense for two-colorable graph states.

Make sure the variables input follow the conventions given in the docstrings,
since not many sanity checks are included.

This should run reasonably well even for bigger states (ca. 10 qubits) if
cythonized.

    ----------

    E : list (or tuple) of tuples
        Should contain 2-tuples with the edges of the graph. Each pair

    -------
    adj : numpy.ndarray

        with N_{ij}=1 if (i,j) is in `E` and 0 otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------

    adj : graph, optional
        Specifies the graphstate considered.
        This function does not use it - only for consistency.

    Returns
    -------
